# Configuration

The Config Manager role is responsible for updating critical protocol parameters that affect yield distribution, rewards handling, and rebalancing operations.

## Configurable Parameters

### Safety Buffer Size

The Config Manager sets the portion of yield that is retained as a safety buffer rather than distributed.

**Purpose:**
- Protects against market volatility
- Absorbs strategy underperformance
- Maintains protocol over-collateralization

**Example:**
```
Safety Buffer: 1,000%
Weekly Yield: $100,000
Buffer Retained: $1,000
Distributed: $99,000
```

### Reward Assets

The Config Manager maintains a whitelist of acceptable reward tokens that the Rewards Manager can claim or sell.

**Purpose:**
- Prevents malicious token operations
- Ensures only legitimate rewards are processed
- Limits operational risk

**Example approved assets:**
- MORPHO (Morpho protocol)
- COMP (Compound)
- CRV (Curve)

### Reward Collector Address

The Config Manager sets the destination address where claimed reward tokens are sent.

**Purpose:**
- Centralizes reward collection
- Enables efficient distribution to chains/dapps

### Rebalancing Collateral Value Slippage

The Config Manager sets the maximum allowable collateral value loss during rebalancing operations.

**Purpose:**
- Protects against excessive value loss during swaps
- Ensures rebalancing doesn't harm protocol health
- Maintains user fund safety

**Example:**
```
Total collateral value: $100,000,000
Max slippage: 0.01% (1 basis point)
Maximum acceptable loss: $10,000
```

If a rebalancing operation would cause collateral value to drop by more than the configured slippage, the transaction reverts.
