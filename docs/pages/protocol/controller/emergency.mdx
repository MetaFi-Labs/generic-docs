# Emergency Procedures

The Emergency Manager role provides critical safeguards to protect user funds during security incidents or market crises. This role is intended as a last resort mechanism.

## Emergency Powers

### Pause and Unpause Operations

The Emergency Manager can halt and resume all protocol operations:

**Pausable Operations:**
- Deposits (minting new units)
- Withdrawals (redeeming units for collateral)

**Process:**
1. Emergency Manager calls pause function
2. All deposits and withdrawals are blocked
3. Investigation and resolution occurs
4. Emergency Manager unpauses when safe

Pausing is a last resort measure used only when continuing normal operations would put user funds at significant risk.

### Emergency Rebalancing Authorization

The Emergency Manager can authorize rebalancing operations even when the unit redemption price falls below $1.00.

**Normal Condition:**
Under standard operations, if the redemption price drops below $1.00, rebalancing that would further decrease collateral value is blocked to protect unit holders.

**Emergency Override:**
In critical situations where rebalancing is necessary despite the redemption price being below peg, the Emergency Manager can grant permission to the Rebalancing Manager to proceed.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Redemption price: $0.98
Collateral asset failing, needs immediate exit
Emergency Manager authorizes rebalancing
Funds moved despite price impact
Prevents total loss, preserves most value
```
