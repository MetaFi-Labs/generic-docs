# Rewards

Many yield-generating strategies provide additional rewards tokens beyond base yield. The protocol has a dedicated system for handling these rewards.

## Reward Sources

Rewards are generated by the collateral strategies deployed in vaults. These serve as additional incentives on top of the base yield earned from lending or staking activities.

**Common reward tokens:**
- MORPHO (from Morpho protocol)
- COMP (from Compound)
- CRV (from Curve)
- Protocol-specific governance tokens

Rewards can be any ERC20 token depending on the underlying strategy.

## Reward Configuration

The **Config Manager** role sets which reward assets are acceptable for claiming and selling. This whitelist approach limits the trust required in the Rewards Manager by restricting operations to pre-approved tokens only.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents malicious token claims
- Ensures only legitimate reward tokens are processed
- Reduces operational risk

## Reward Management

The **Rewards Manager** role has two options for handling rewards:

### Option 1: Sell Rewards

- Converts reward tokens into protocol collateral assets (USDC, USDT, USDS)
- Executes swaps via integrated DEXes
- Deposits converted assets back into vaults
- Increases total collateral value, boosting yield for distribution

**Example:**
```
1. Morpho vault earns 1,000 MORPHO tokens
2. Rewards Manager sells MORPHO for 5,000 USDC
3. 5,000 USDC is deposited back into vaults
4. Increased collateral creates additional yield
```

### Option 2: Claim Rewards

- Claims reward tokens from underlying protocols
- Transfers tokens to a designated address
- Rewards are distributed to chains and dapps
- Chains/dapps use rewards as additional incentives for their users

**Use Case:**
When reward tokens have value beyond their market price (e.g., governance rights, ecosystem benefits), claiming and distributing them directly can provide more value than selling.

**Example:**
```
1. Morpho vault earns 1,000 MORPHO tokens
2. Rewards Manager claims the MORPHO tokens
3. Tokens distributed: Chain A (600 MORPHO), Chain B (400 MORPHO)
4. Chains distribute MORPHO to their users as bonus incentives
```
